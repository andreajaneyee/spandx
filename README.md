A portfolio for my university course [DECO3850](https://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=DECO3850) (Physical Computing & Interaction Design Studio). SpandX is the name of the project we built and exhibited at The Edge over at the State Library of Queensland at the end of the semester. Good stuff ðŸ‘Œ

Developed with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery.
