                    <p>Team Rogue Learning created SpandX over the course of this hectic semester. SpandX provides a new and visual way of teaching the basic concept of the heliocentric model in which the earth and all other planets revolve around the sun. Over the semester, we’ve developed a simulated solar system through Unity that can be manipulated. We combined that with a Kinect sensor, projector, and a table with a stretchy spandex surface to create a learning tool that allows for kinesthetic and visual learning. This digital solar system is then projected onto the spandex surface so the user can watch the changes happen as they interact with it. They do so by pushing down on the spandex surface, the Kinect then picks up on how far they’ve pushed down and translates that by increasing the mass of the sun which also increases its speed and gravity.</p>
                    <h2 class="headings">Who is it for?</h2>
                    <p>SpandX is aimed at grade 3 students because this is when they’re typically introduced to basic concepts of the solar system and the day and night cycle. Rather than learning about these concepts from a textbook or an iPad, SpandX provides live visualisations and encourages children to use their upper body to push down on the fabric as hard as they can. </p>

All throughout the semester, everyone.</p>

                    <h2 class="headings">Background</h2>
                    <p>The interaction design of our concept was inspired by a lot of other previous installations like Aaron Sherwood’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/54882144">Firewall</a> and <a href="https://uqmozart.github.io/">MozArt</a> by Good Vibes. We went with the space theme because we were inspired by the Kerbal Space Program and a bunch of other cool space exploration stuff (space is cool). The name of our concept is also a little homage to Elon Musk’s SpaceX program. After doing some research and speaking to people in the education industry, we learned that grade 3 students are introduced to the basic concepts of the solar system and so we decided to apply this approach in our concept.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>We went through several iterations of our design that would suit our capabilities and the tight time frame we had (I made a cool poster of this below). We also had a lot of trouble narrowing down which aspect of the solar system we wanted to cover since there was so much information a grade 3 student would learn. The design of the interface was also an issue and integrating that with our interaction design did prove to be a little difficult. In the end, we cut a lot of features our because we wanted to keep things simple for the exhibition and also because we didn’t have enough time to implement all those extra features. When we did start physical construction, things got a lot easier and started falling into place.</p>
                    <h2 class="headings">Exhibition</h2>
                    <div class="image-slider">
                        <img src="assets/images/ex1.JPG" alt="Exhibition picture 1">

                    </div>
                    <p>I thought our exhibition went quite well, aside from the fact that our projector broke down towards the start of the night, everything went pretty smoothly-ish. High school students that came along to test our product thought that it would have been helpful for them if they had some reactive visual device to show them basic concepts about the solar system. Students from our target audience thought that it was fun to push down on and gave us the validation we wanted, they claimed that they understood what was happening in the simulator but I’m not sure how true that was.<br>
                    It would have been ideal to have more features implemented or perhaps different modes of interaction for this prototype because all we had was something you could push down on and place heavy physical objects on. Our reset button was a little misleading as well because people thought that they could press on it to reset but it is what it is. I was still quite pleased with the outcome and that we had something to show.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I was in charge of the prints that we had on at the exhibition and I organised the setup of our stand and made sure everything was in place. I also made little goodie bags to hand out to the public in little space themed baubles (people loved them) and had our logo 3D printed to use as brooches for the exhibition. I also helped with physical construction and testing. I like to think that I was the one who whipped my team members into shape, because it often felt like we weren’t getting enough done especially at the start of the semester. I nagged for us to make visits to Reverse Garbage and Bunnings to start finding and purchasing materials that we’d need and really pushed for progress. I mean, I know my team wanted stuff done but it didn’t feel like things were moving fast enough.
