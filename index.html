                    <p>Team Rogue Learning created SpandX over the course of this hectic semester. SpandX provides a new and visual way of teaching the basic concept of the heliocentric model in which the earth and all other planets revolve around the sun. Over the semester, we’ve developed a simulated solar system through Unity that can be manipulated. We combined that with a Kinect sensor, projector, and a table with a stretchy spandex surface to create a learning tool that allows for kinesthetic and visual learning. This digital solar system is then projected onto the spandex surface so the user can watch the changes happen as they interact with it. They do so by pushing down on the spandex surface, the Kinect then picks up on how far they’ve pushed down and translates that by increasing the mass of the sun which also increases its speed and gravity.</p>
                    <h2 class="headings">Who is it for?</h2>
                    <p>SpandX is aimed at grade 3 students because this is when they’re typically introduced to basic concepts of the solar system and the day and night cycle. Rather than learning about these concepts from a textbook or an iPad, SpandX provides live visualisations and encourages children to use their upper body to push down on the fabric as hard as they can. </p>

                    Despite having our assigned individual roles, we worked cross-functionally as a team. Eddie did a lot of the background research and the physical construction, Mitchell shot the video and did the physical construction, while Gabby developed our entire Unity program and helped out with graphics and prints. All throughout the semester, everyone did all that they could to achieve our overarching goal, which was to have a functioning piece to display at the exhibition. Sure, we did have plenty of creative differences and clashes in opinion, but we managed to pull through and produced  a working prototype that we were proud to display at The Edge.</p>

                    <p>In retrospect, I shouldn't have added so much text to my poster since the whole point was to let the sketch speak for itself. I think I got a little too excited and wrote everything that I could think of down because this was the night before the presentation and all I wanted to do was sleep.</p>
